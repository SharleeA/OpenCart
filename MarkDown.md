### Q:  How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
A: I spent about 5hrs to set up the framework and script the tests. If I had more time I will use pageFactory to improve scalability and maintainability. I will also consider implement browser capability for other commonly used browsers for e-commerce website. Maybe consider parallelization if large number of tests needs to be run in short period of time.

### Q: How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?
A: In general, automation is an investment for any application. Automation is not ideal for applications already reached its end of life cycle, 
For critical legacy applications, it is best to test the software's logic tier, because it is most unlikely to change compare to its presentation tier. There are tools for API testing, such as SoapUI, Jmeter, and RestAssured.

I never need to build new scripts for a legacy system. I support existing scripts built in SoapUI.
